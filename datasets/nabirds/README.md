nabirds
-------

Due to Cornell's licensing restrictions I cannot include a copy of the nabirds
dataset here. However, I can tell you how to get it.

Go here and fill out the form:
https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds

Extract the tarball into a directory called 'nabirds'

Then run `./process.py` to process the dataset into a format compatible with
YOLOv5's training script.
